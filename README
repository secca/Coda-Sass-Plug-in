This is a Sass plug-in for Panic's Coda.

This plug-in converts scss files into css files. You can set it up to automatically convert on save. By default you must manually process scss files via the Coda Plug-ins menu. You can also specify where the css files should be saved. By default they are saved next to the scss files.


To Install, unzip the SassPlug-in.zip file then copy Sass.codaplugin to the folder:
<your home folder>/Library/Application Support/Coda/Plug-ins

If you can't see your Library folder under Mac OS X Lion, hold down the option key and then select Library from the Go menu in the Finder.
